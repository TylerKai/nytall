# nytall

A simple one-function package that uses a timed loop and some field
simplification to collect all New York Times article search API data for
a given search term. Collects a max of 2,000 articles in each search
year at a rate of 75 articles/min. Warning: May take a significant
amount of time to collect large amount of articles.

## Installation

Currently, you can only install through github.

    devtools::install_github("toldham2/nytall")

*Dependents will be downloaded automatically: jsonlite (>= 1.7.2), plyr
(>= 1.8.6), stringr (>= 1.4.0)*

## Overview

First, create an account or sign in to the [The New York Times Developer
Network](https://developer.nytimes.com/), create a new app, and copy the
API key. Youâ€™ll need the key later.

    nyt_key <- "ENTER_YOUR_KEY_HERE"

### Get Data

After installing, library this package and run `get_articles`:

    library(nytall)

    df <- get_articles(term = "google", start = 1999, nyt_key = nyt_key, years = 1)

*Extra variables cut for presentation, see documentation for all 31 text variables*

You may also run `get_articles` without the `years` argument to get all years up to the present year:

    df <- get_articles(term = "biden", start = 2018, nyt_key = nyt_key)

### Clean and export

In order to export to a spreadsheet, run:

    df <- subset(df, select = -c(response.docs.multimedia, response.docs.keywords, response.docs.byline.person))

    write.csv(df, "path/to/file.csv")

## Documentation

- `term`: A string defining the search term. Use single apostrophes around
#' term for exact matches.
- `start`: A numeric year (YYYY) to start the search in.
- `nyt_key` A string defining your New York Times API key: https://developer.nytimes.com/
- `years`: (Optional) A numeric number of years to search after the start year. Default or NULL gets all data from start to current year.
